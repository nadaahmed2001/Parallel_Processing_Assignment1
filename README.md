Assignment 1 in High Performance Computing (Parallel Processing)
- Using MPI_SEND & MPI_RECV ONLY.
- Running the C code on Ubuntu terminal on virtual box
- Must install MPI first
 ## Problem 1:
 Develop a parallel program that outputs max number in a given array.
    
-> Note:\
Size of array may not be divisible by number of processes. So, this case must be handeled

## Problem 2 (Matrix Multiplication)
Write a matrix multiplication program, Matricesâ€™ dimensions and values are taken as
an input.\
Take input from console and from file.\
Must use dynamic allocation.
